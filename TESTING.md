## __Testing__
### __PEP8 CI Validation__

An online validation tool (provided by CI) was used to check that the code is up to standard.

Firstly, I have had a lot of: ``lines too long (81 > 79 characters)`` errors which I have rectified by moving long lines into the second line of code or by shoring code where possible.

Finally, validated with no errors.
