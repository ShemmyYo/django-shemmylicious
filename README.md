# Project Goal

The project goal was to build a Full-Stack site based on business logic and create user friendly, commerially focused project that uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python+Django as well as centrally-owned dataset (ElephantSQL relational database).

In this project I will present my ability to:

- use Agile methodologies (agile tool - Github projects) to track the tasks involved in creating the project relating to identified user stories.

- implement front-end CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) functionality, including front-end UI that allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete records in the database, without having to access the admin panel.

- set up an authentication mechanism and provide role-based access to the site's data or other activities based on the dataset.

# UX User Experiance

## Design

### Colour Scheme
***
I opted for a very minimalistic aesthetic and only apllied 3 colours (2 with additional shades) to this project.

```css
root {
    --background-col: #45575A;
    --light-gray-col: #9A99A2;
    --light-col: #E4E5EA;
    --accent-col: #3DC073;
    --basic-col: #198754;
}
```

To provide a better user experience, I went for a bright theme with an hints of green to add spice to the site. 
The colours have been implemented across the site and are included in the buttons/links and their hover effects.

I used <img height="14" src="README/colormind-logo.png"> [Colormind](http://colormind.io/) colour scheme for this project:

![Colormind](README/colormind.png)


### Typography
***
The two fonts used were imported into the CSS from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

I used 'Sen' for logo, menues and all headings.

![Sen Font](README/sen-font.png)
![Sen Font](README/sen-font2.png)

'Lucida Sans' has been used as a additional font for paragraphs any other text.
'Sans-serif' is the nominated fallback font.

```CSS 
root {
    --main-font: 'Sen', sans-serif;
    --additional-font: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;
}
```

### Imaginary
***

I designed a Shemmylicious logo with <img height="20" src="README/figma-logo.png"> [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

same logo has then been used to create [Favicon](https://favicon.io/) icons.

## Agile 

### The Ideal User/Persona

Food blog users are passionate about all things culinary and seek to expand their knowledge and skills in the kitchen, while also enjoying the social aspects of sharing their experiences with others.

**Who**: This persona is passionate about food and enjoys exploring new flavors and cuisines. They are likely to prioritize taste over convenience or health benefits. Marketing messages that emphasize the unique and delicious flavors of your products, as well as the high quality ingredients, will appeal to this persona.
A women aged 25 to 34 are our biggest recipe-browsing demographic group. But that's followed closely by women, ages 55 to 64.

**What**: A food blog user is typically someone who is interested in cooking, eating, and exploring different types of cuisine. They may be a beginner cook looking for recipe inspiration, or a more experienced cook looking to expand their knowledge and skills in the kitchen. 

**Why**: Some common characteristics of a food-blog user include:

- Food Enthusiast: They have a passion for food and enjoy trying new recipes and ingredients.
- Health Conscious: They may be interested in healthy eating and look for recipes that are nutritious and balanced.
- Adventurous: They enjoy trying new things and experimenting with different flavors and cuisines.
- Time-Conscious: They may be looking for recipes that are quick and easy to prepare, or that can be made ahead of time for convenience.
- Social: They may enjoy sharing their own food experiences with others, and may be active on social media platforms related to food and cooking.
- Budget-Conscious: They may be looking for recipes that are affordable and that use ingredients that are readily available.
- Knowledge-Seeking: They may be interested in learning more about different types of cuisine, cooking techniques, and food history.
- Community-Oriented: They may be interested in connecting with other food enthusiasts and bloggers, and may participate in online forums or groups related to food and cooking.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

This project was developed using agile methodologies by delivering small features (User Stories) across the project.

The Kanban board was created using Github projects and can be located [here](https://github.com/users/ShemmyYo/projects/5/views/1) and can be viewed to see more information on the project cards. 

Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and label user stories.
User Stories were assigned to Epics, prioritized under the labels:

- `MUST HAVE` - guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- `SHOULD HAVE` - adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- `COULD HAVE` - has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- `WON'T HAVE` - not a priority for this iteration

To ensure that all core requirements were completed I worked on the 'MUST HAVE' epics/user stories first.

A few `COULD HAVE` user stories have been implemented before project due date i.e. ...

[__Setting up basic Django Project and Deploying to Heroku__](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P5CWvS5cYalkQOLeQiijpSViDPogtKM7ZGyqK-yehhQ/edit)

Install librieries:
pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn
pip3 install dj_database_url==0.5.0 psycopg2
pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage

Create requirements.txt
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

START NEW PROJECT 
django-admin startproject PROJECT_NAME .



## Deployment

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://tribe.herokuapp.com).

### ElephantSQL Database

This project uses [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) for the PostgreSQL Database.

To obtain your own Postgres Database, sign-up with your GitHub account, then follow these steps:
- Click **Create New Instance** to start a new database.
- Provide a name (this is commonly the name of the project: tribe).
- Select the **Tiny Turtle (Free)** plan.
- You can leave the **Tags** blank.
- Select the **Region** and **Data Center** closest to you.
- Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL and Password.

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.
- For *Primary interest*, you can choose *Programmable Media for image and video API*.
- Optional: *edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable*.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | insert your own Cloudinary API key here |
| `DATABASE_URL` | insert your own ElephantSQL database URL here |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | this can be any random secret key |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.
- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:
- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:
- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:
- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:
- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "insert your own Cloudinary API key here")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "insert your own ElephantSQL database URL here")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "this can be any random secret key")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:
- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `âŒ˜+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

#### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/adamgilroy22/tribe)
